        <h3>Perhaps no food is more beloved by Norwegians than lefse. Prepared on special lefse griddles
                and turned with a long wooden stick, this thin potato flatbread is best served warm with butter and sugar. </h3>

            <div class="title"><h2>Ingredients</h2></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 pounds Idaho russet potatoes, about 5 large potatoes</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup flour, plus more for dusting</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>For serving</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Butter, to taste</li>
                    <li>Sugar, to taste</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="title"><h2>Steps to make it</h2></div>
            <h3>Make the Dough</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 175 F. Peel the potatoes, making sure that
                    no peels or eyes remain. Coarsely chop them into 1-inch pieces.</li>
                    <li>In a stockpot, bring water to a boil and add the potatoes. Boil them
                    until they are fork-tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain the boiled potatoes well. Place them on a baking sheet lined with
                    parchment paper and bring them into the hot oven for 15 minutes to dry them further.</li>
                    <li>Remove the potatoes from the oven and pass them through a ricer. You need them to be finely riced,
                        so twice through the ricer might give you a better texture. You should have at least 4 cups of
                        riced potatoes. </li>
                    <li>Mix in the heavy cream, butter, sugar, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Mix well and place the potato dough in the refrigerator, covered, to chill overnight.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Shape the Lefse</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat a lefse griddle or your skillet of choice to 425 F. You need a very hot surface to properly
                        cook the lefse. Use a pastry blender to cut the flour into the chilled potatoes, or vigorously knead
                        the flour in until you have a smooth dough.</li>
                    <li>With the help of an ice cream scoop, divide the dough into 16 to 20 biscuit-sized balls.</li>
                    <li>Generously flour a pastry cloth or board and a rolling pin. Roll out each piece of dough into a 12-inch
                        circle, dusting with more flour as needed.</li>
                    <li>Carefully lift the circle with a lefse stick or the handle of a flat wooden spatula. Transfer it quickly to the griddle.</li>
                    <li>Cook the lefse on the griddle until brown spots begin to appear.</li>
                    <li>Flip and cook the other side.</li>
                    <li>Remove the cooked lefse to a plate lined with a damp clean cloth to cool. Cover with another damp cloth. Continue to cook the
                        remaining dough balls until you've used all of the dough.</li>
                    <li>Serve the lefse smeared with butter to taste and a sprinkle or two of sugar.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
